This [paper](doc/paper.pdf) discusses computational methods on a class of elliptic HJB-PDE. In this below, we include some computational results implemented by Python and Pytorch. All codes are provided with colab link, which can be implemented with  zero installation and zero programming skills.

- [1-d](src/hjb_1d_v01.ipynb): This includes both tabular methods and neural netowrk approach on 1-d computations.
- [2-d tab](src/hjb_2d_tabular_v01.ipynb): This includes tabular methods on 2-d computations.
- [2-d nn](https://github.com/songqsh/capstone20-1/blob/master/README.md): This includes neural network approach on 2-d computations.
